COSC499 - Git exercise

## Summary: 
This repo is a demo for showing how to use git.

## The code:
The code includes two features: feature1 and feature2

 ### feature1:
  This is a function which takes in an array of integers and return the sum of them.
  
 ### feature2:
  This is a function which takes in an array of strings, sorts them in ascending alaphabetic order, then return the concatenation of all the words

## History:
I made two branches off of the main branch, one for each feature. Then, I created seperate features on each feature branch and then push it to origin. Next, I created a pull request for feature1 and pulled it into main. Then I did the same with feature2, except there was a merge conflict. I fixed the merge conflict on GitHub. Weirdly, main was merged into feature2, then feature2 automatically merged into main (which was the same code). So now feature2 and main are equivalent in code sense.
